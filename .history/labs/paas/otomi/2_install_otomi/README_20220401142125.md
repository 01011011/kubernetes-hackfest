# Lab 2: Installing Otomi on AKS

## Add the Otomi repository

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

## Minimal Values

Create a `values.yaml` file with the following values:

```yaml
cluster:
  k8sVersion: '1.21'
  name: mycluster
  provider: Azure
```

## Install the Chart

Install the chart with the following command:

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml otomi otomi/otomi
```

## Monitoring the Chart install

The chart deploys a Job (`otomi`) in the `default` namespace. Monitor the chart install using `kubectl`:

```bash
# get the status of the job
kubectl get job otomi -w
# watch the helm chart install status:
watch helm list -Aa
```

Or view detailed info about Kubernetes resources with [k9s](https://k9scli.io)

When the installer job has finished, go to the bottom of the installer job logs. There you will see the following:

#  To start using Otomi, go to https://<your-ip>.nip.io and sign in to the web console 
#  with username "otomi-admin" and password "password".
#  Then activate Drone. For more information see: https://otomi.io/docs/installation/post-install/

## Sign in to the web UI (Otomi Console)

Once Otomi is installed, go to the url provided in the installer job and sign in to the web UI with the provided username and password.

## Add the auto generated CA to your keychain (optional)

Because we install Otomi without proving a custom CA or using LetsEncrypt, the installer generated a CA. This CA is of course not trusted on your local machine. To prevent you from clicking away lots of security warning in your browser, you can add the generated CA to your keychain:

- In the left pane of the console, click on "Download CA"
- Double click the downloaded CA.crt or add the CA to your keychain on your mac using the following command:

```
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Downloads/ca.crt
```

But you could also run Chrome (sorry guys ;) in insecure mode:

```
alias chrome-insecure='/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-urlfetcher-cert-requests &> /dev/null'
```

## Activate Drone

1. Click on the **Drone** app (under Platform/Apps) in the console
2. Click on the `play` button in the right top. A new tab will open for Drone
3. Sign in locally with the provided username and password.
4. Click on `Authorize Application`
5. Click on `Submit on the Complete your Drone Registration page. You don't need to fill in your Email, Full Name or Company Name if you don't want to
6. Click on the `otomi/values` repository
7. Click on `+ Activate Repository`
