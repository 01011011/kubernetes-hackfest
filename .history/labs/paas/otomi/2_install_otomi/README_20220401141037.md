# Lab 2: Installing Otomi on AKS

## Add the Otomi repository

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

## Minimal Values

Create a `values.yaml` file with the following values:

```yaml
cluster:
  k8sVersion: '1.21'
  name: mycluster
  provider: Azure
```

## Install the Chart

Install the chart with the following command:

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml otomi otomi/otomi
```

## Monitoring the Chart install

The chart deploys a Job (`otomi`) in the `default` namespace. Monitor the chart install using `kubectl`:

```bash
# get the status of the job
kubectl get job otomi -w
# watch the helm chart install status:
watch helm list -Aa
```

Or view detailed info about kubernetes resources with [k9s](https://k9scli.io)

## Sign in

Once Otomi is installed, follow the [Post Installation steps](/docs/installation/post-install) to get ready to use Otomi.

## Add the auto generated CA to your keychain

Because we install Otomi without proving a custom CA or using LetsEncrypt, the installer generated a CA. This CA is of course not trusted on your local machine. To prevent you from clicking away lots of security warning in your browser, you can add the generated CA to your keychain:

- In the left pane of the console, click on "Download CA"
- Double click the downloaded CA.crt or add the CA to your keychain on your mac using the following command:

```
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Downloads/ca.crt
```

But you could also run Chrome (sorry guys ;) in insecure mode:

```
alias chrome-insecure='/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-urlfetcher-cert-requests &> /dev/null'
```

Sign in locally username: "otomi-admin", and password: `$otomi.adminPassword` or the auto-generated password provided in the logs of the installer job).

4. Click on `Authorize Application`
