# Lab 2: Installing Otomi on AKS

## Add the Otomi repository

```bash
helm repo add otomi https://otomi.io/otomi-core
helm repo update
```

## Minimal Values

```yaml
cluster:
  k8sVersion: '1.21' # currently 1.18, 1.19, 1.20 and 1.21 are supported
  name: # the name of your cluster
  provider: # choose between aws, azure, google
```



## Install the Chart

Install the chart with the following command:

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml otomi otomi/otomi
```

### Monitoring the Chart install

The chart deploys a Job (`otomi`) in the `default` namespace. Monitor the chart install using `kubectl`:

```bash
# get the status of the job
kubectl get job otomi -w
# watch the helm chart install status:
watch helm list -Aa
```

Or view detailed info about kubernetes resources with [k9s](https://k9scli.io)

### Next steps

Once Otomi is installed, follow the [Post Installation steps](/docs/installation/post-install) to get ready to use Otomi.

## Installing from source

As an alternative, you can also clone the otomi-core source code from the [Github](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core) and install otomi using the chart source code.

### Download source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core.git
cd otomi-core
```

### Install from source

Now customize the `values.yaml` file. See [configuration](#configuring) below for more details.

Use the following command to install the chart with the name `my-otomi-release` (a custom name that you choose).

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml my-otomi-release chart/otomi
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

```bash
helm uninstall my-otomi-release
```

Doing a Helm uninstall will only remove the job used to deploy Otomi. It will not remove all the installed components. If you would like to do a complete uninstall, we advise to first clone the `otomi/values` repository (to secure the configuration) and then uninstall using Otomi CLI.
