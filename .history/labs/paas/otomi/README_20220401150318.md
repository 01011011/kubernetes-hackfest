# Otomi: Self-hosted PaaS for AKS

[Otomi](https://otomi.io/) is an open source self-hosted PaaS for Kubernetes and connects many of the technologies found in the CNCF landscape in a single installable package to provide direct value to developers. All used technologies are fully integrated and pre-configured. Combined with a configuration as code and a GitOps way of working (where disired state is reflected as code and automatically synchronised to the cluster), multi-tenancy and developer self-service, Otomi brings a full PaaS (like Heroku) to your own Kubernetes cluster.
