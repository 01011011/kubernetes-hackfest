# Lab 5

In this lab we are going to activate some additional apps. Otomi by default ships with a minimal set of apps. These are called the Core apps. With the Core, Otomi offers an advanced ingress architecture, using Nginx, Istio, Keycloak, Certmanager and Oauth2, combined with developer self-service. Next to the Core apps, Otomi offers additional apps like Knative, Harbor, Vault, Kubeapps, Prometheus, Loki, Alertmanager. These apps all fully integrated and can be activated by dragging them to the active apps section in the Console.

## Instructions

1. Go to the `Apps` section under `Platform`

2. Drag and Drop `Grafana`

Optional: Go to the [next lab](../6_knative/README.md)
